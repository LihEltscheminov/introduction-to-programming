			<p> <em>The name "monarch" is believed to have been given in honor of King William III of England, as the butterfly's main color is that of the king's secondary title Prince of Orange.</em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span><strong>Scientific Species</strong></span>: D. plexippus</li>
				<li><span> <strong>Average Lifespan</strong></span>: From 2 to 6 weeks.</li>
				<li><span> <strong>Average Wingspan</strong></span>: It ranges from 8.9 to 10.2 centimetres. </li>
				<li><span><strong>Habitat</strong></span>: Tropical and subtropical latitudes. </li>
			</ul>
			<p> The upper sides of the wings are tawny orange, the veins and margins are black, and there are two series of small white spots in the margins. Monarch forewings also have a few orange spots near their tips. Wing undersides are similar, but the tips of forewings and hindwings are yellow brown instead of tawny orange and the white spots are larger. The shape and color of the wings change at the beginning of the migration and appear redder and more elongated than later migrants. Wings size and shape differ between migratory and non-migratory monarchs.</p>
