            HTML is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions. 
            <p>HTML stands for <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong>. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications. HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn't have the ability to create dynamic functionality.

            <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:<br><br>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The opening tag</strong>: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in <em>opening and closing angle brackets</em>. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.<br><br>
                <li><strong>The closing tag</strong>: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.<br><br> 
                <li><strong>The content</strong>: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.<br><br>   
                <li><strong>The element</strong>: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.<br><br>    
            </ol>
